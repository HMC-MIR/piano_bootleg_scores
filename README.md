# Piano Bootleg Scores

This repository contains pre-computed bootleg score features for all piano scores in the IMSLP dataset.  It also contains code for computing bootleg score features on a PDF or image file.

The dataset and feature representation are described in the ISMIR 2020 paper "Camera-Based Piano Sheet Music Identification."
